## Typechecking

* VS Code has TypeScript at its core
* TypeChecking is becoming increasingly popular
  * React's [proptypes](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) (runtime)
  * Facebook's [flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) (static)
  * MicroSoft's [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (static)
* TypeScript is a *typed superset* of JavaScript
  * It heavily relies on type inference
* [As of TypeScript 2.3](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Type-Checking-JavaScript-Files) VS Code can apply this to your JavaScript
* Type information can be added via JSDoc comments!

<br><br><br><br>

## Why would I want to use types?

* Catch more bugs at compile time
* Better developer experience
* Your code becomes a better expression of your intent
* Avoid common situations where your code is de-optimized

<br><br><br><br>

## Categories of Type Systems

#### Nominal Typing
Decisions about whether types are equivalent are made based on their **name**.

#### Structural Typing
Decisions about whether types are equivalent are made based their **structure**.
```ts
interface CartItem {
  item: {
    name: string
    description: string
    price: number
  }
  quantity: number
}
```

Because VS Code uses TypeScript to check our code, and its type system is **structural**.

<br><br><br><br>


## Annotating Types with JSDoc
* Types can be added with comments
```js
/** @type {number} */
let value;

value = 21;   // ‚úÖ Ok
value = '21'; // üö´ Not Ok
```
* Constructors are regarded as types too!
* Remember, this is still structural!
  * TypeScript has a built-in type definition for the DOM API and other common JavaScript constructs

```js
/** @type {Element} */
let x = document.querySelector('passwordField');
```

* Sometimes we work with code that provides us with a less specific type than what we want
* In the above class, perhaps we really wanted the JavaScript representation of an `<input>`, not just a generic element!

```js
/** @type {HTMLInputElement} */
let x = document.querySelector('passwordField');
// üõë Type 'Element' is not assignable to type 'HTMLInputElement'
// üõë Property 'accept' is missing in type 'Element'.
```
* This would be no problem if `Element`'s structure was a superset of `HTMLInputElement`'s, but it's the other way around.
* The TypeScript compiler has found that `Element` is lacking the [accept](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-accept) property
* We can perform an explicit type conversion (type casting)

```js
/** @type {HTMLInputElement} */
let x = /** @type {HTMLInputElement} */(
  document.querySelector('passwordField')
);
```
* At this point, the explicit declaration doesn't add any value

```js
let x = /** @type {HTMLInputElement} */(
  document.querySelector('passwordField')
);
```

<br><br><br><br>

## Functions

* Function is a first-class value type
* We can also define a structure of a function (args)

```js
/** @type {function(MouseEvent)[]} */
let mouseListeners = [];

addEventListener('keypress', function(evt) {
  mouseListeners.forEach(ml => {
    ml(evt);
    // üõë Argument of type 'KeyboardEvent' is not assignable to parameter of type 'MouseEvent'.
    //    Property 'button' is missing in type 'KeyboardEvent'.
  });
});
```
* Arrow functions can also be used to define argument types
```js
/** @type {(request: Request) => Response} */
let requestHandler = function(x) {
  return new Response('<h1>Hello World</h1>')
};
```
* Note that we have defined a return type as well here. We could also have used `@return`
* **keep in mind:** this is just static analysis. Arguments aren't checked until you try to invoke a function

<br><br><br><br>

## Generics

* Operate across many types
* Still maintain compile-time type safety

```js
/**
 * Returns an array containing 5 of whatever you want
 * @template T
 * @param {T} item
 * @return {T[]} 
 */
function gimmieFive(item) {
  return new Array(5).fill(item, 0, 5);
}

let students = gimmieFive('students');
students.push('teacher'); // ‚úÖ

let objects = gimmieFive({key: 'Object'});
objects.push({});
// üõë Argument of type '{}' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ key: string; }'.
//   Property 'key' is missing in type '{}'.
```

* Promises and other things that wrap other values (which have their own types) are define using this concept of generics
* Be careful when mising with JSX!
```js
/** @type {PromiseLike<Window>} */
let x;
x = Promise.resolve(window);
```

<br><br><br><br>

## Defining our own named types
* We can use `@typedef` to create a new named type of our own
* Two ways to do this:
```js
/**
 * @typedef {Object} InventoryItem
 * @param {string} name
 * @param {number} price
 */
/**
 * @typedef {{qty: number, item: InventoryItem}} InvoiceItem
 */

/** @type {InvoiceItem[]} */
let invoice = [];
invoice.push({
  qty: 2,
  item: {
    name: 'Apple',
    price: 1.32
  }
}); // ‚úÖ

invoice.push({bad: 'thing'}); // üõë
```

# Exercise 3: Data Layer Types
> * Update the [TypeScript compiler configuration](../../tsconfig.json) to
>   * `"checkJs": true` - Type-check JavaScript files
>   * `"noImplicitAny": true` - Complain about "implicit any" types (i.e., require us to provide an explicit type in spots where the compiler can't infer well enough)
> * Add a variety of JSDoc type annotations to
>   * [client/data/cart-store.js](../../client/data/cart-store.js) 
>   * [client/data/grocery-item-store.js](../../client/data/grocery-item-store.js) 
>   * [client/data/order-store.js](../../client/data/order-store.js) 
> * Try to avoid use of the `any` type, if possible
